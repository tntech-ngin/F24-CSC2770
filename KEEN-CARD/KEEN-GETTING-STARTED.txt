Game: "Basic Interplanetary Systems Challenge"

Objective:
Two groups, each representing a colony on a different planet, must build a basic computer system and establish simple communication between the two colonies using sticky notes. The game focuses on fundamental hardware and software components, basic networking, and number representation.
Setup

    Materials Needed:
        Sticky notes in different colors (each color represents a different category: hardware, software, networking, etc.)
        Markers
        Two large boards or poster papers (one for each group/planet)

    Categories and Colors for Sticky Notes:
        Hardware Components (Yellow Sticky Notes): CPU, RAM, Hard Drive, Power Supply, Monitor, Keyboard.
        Software Components (Pink Sticky Notes): Operating System, Basic Application Software.
        Networking Components (Green Sticky Notes): Simple Router, Network Cable.
        Processes and Concepts (Blue Sticky Notes): Simple Instructions (like "LOAD", "STORE"), Basic Data Flow.
        Number Representation (Orange Sticky Notes): Binary, Decimal, Hexadecimal.

    Instructions:
        Each group receives a set of sticky notes corresponding to different components and concepts.
        Each group works on a separate board representing their planet, where they must build a basic computer system and establish a simple network.

Gameplay
Phase 1: Build the Planetary Computer System (15 minutes)

    Activity: Each group begins by building the fundamental components of a computer system.
        Task 1: Place sticky notes for basic hardware components (e.g., CPU, RAM, Hard Drive) and draw simple connections between them to show the internal structure.
        Task 2: Add sticky notes for basic software components (e.g., Operating System, Basic Applications) on top of the hardware layer.
        Task 3: Use blue sticky notes to indicate simple processes like data loading and storing operations.

Phase 2: Establish Basic Planetary Network (10 minutes)

    Activity: Groups create a basic network to connect their computer systems within their planet.
        Task 4: Use green sticky notes to represent a simple router and network cables connecting multiple computer systems (represented by clusters of sticky notes).
        Task 5: Indicate basic data flow arrows to show how information moves between systems.

Phase 3: Simple Interplanetary Communication Setup (10 minutes)

    Activity: The two planets must establish a basic communication link.
        Task 6: Use a green sticky note to represent a "Space Cable" that connects the two planetary networks. This sticky note is placed between the boards of the two groups.
        Task 7: Each group decides on a basic protocol for sending and receiving simple messages between the planets (e.g., using binary to represent "Hello" or "OK").

Phase 4: Number Representation Challenge (10 minutes)

    Activity: Introduce a simple data transmission challenge using number representations.
        Task 8: Groups must convert a decimal number to binary and hexadecimal using orange sticky notes and "send" it to the other planet over the "Space Cable."
        Task 9: The receiving group must decode the message back into decimal and confirm the received number.

Phase 5: Simple Scenario Challenge (10 minutes)

    Activity: Introduce a basic problem-solving scenario.
        Scenario Example: A power failure occurs, and a critical component (like the CPU or RAM) must be "repaired" or replaced. Groups must rearrange their sticky notes to show an alternative setup using the remaining components.
        Task 10: Each group quickly adapts their setup to maintain system functionality with the new constraints.

Phase 6: Debrief and Scoring (5 minutes)

    Activity: Groups present their final setups and explain their strategic choices, including how they solved the scenario-based challenge.
    Scoring Criteria:
        System Completeness: Correct placement and connection of all fundamental components.
        Network Setup: Successful creation of a basic local and interplanetary network.
        Problem Solving: Effective response to the scenario challenge.
        Number Representation: Accurate conversion and transmission of numbers.
