Scenario Overview:
In the year 2145, humanity has established a colony on the distant planet Epsilon 6. The colony&amp;rsquo;s survival depends on building, managing, and optimizing interconnected computer systems that handle everything from life support and resource management to defense and communication. Each team represents a different faction within the colony (e.g., Engineering, Medical, Defense), responsible for maintaining a critical subsystem.</description></item><item><title>Lab1</title><link>https://tntech-ngin.github.io/F24-CSC2770/docs/prologue/lab1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2023 11:09:01 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://tntech-ngin.github.io/F24-CSC2770/docs/prologue/lab1/</guid><description>Instructions #
Note: The following guide provides step-by-step instructions for creating and configuring virtual machines (VMs) on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Subsequently, the guide outlines the process of establishing network connectivity between these VMs using the “ping” command. This exercise aims to provide students with a practical understanding of cloud-based virtualization, network configuration, and basic connectivity testing. This lab is ungraded.
